# BLACKCOIN 8th-anniversary.-mdx

A new community economy to continue pending plans (Foundation?)

Today, our community has 3,3 millonns of USDts as general marketcap (BLK=$0,0538) and 61 millons of BLKs as ciculating supply.
We could generate a new token on top of Blackcoin and on top of another blockchains as BSC (we could make some kind of voting around other blockchains too)
This new token could be distributed with BLK stakers 1 to 1 at the moment of Blackcoin 8th anniversary. (define exactly the block number) So, the addresses that stake their coins at that block, will receive the new tokens.
So, if we create 100,000,000 of BLKOs, 61.5 millons for the stakers and another 38,5 millons for new users.
We could set the price of the 38,5 millons of BLKOs (the new token) with just 4 sell orders (like sell walls)

- 3.5 millons at the price of Blackcoin at his 8th anniversary (today 0,054 / 189.000usdt)
- 5 millons at 5X of the 8th anniversary (0,054x5=0,27)x5M= 1.350.000  
-5 millons at 25x (0,054x25=1.35) x5m =6,75M
-5 Millons at 125X (0,054x125=6,75) x5m =33,5M
Every time that people fulfill every sell orders, price will jump to the another one with some sells orders in between (I believe that)

1 target- 189.000 usdt  (easy)
2 target- 1.539.000 usdt (not so easy)
3 target- 8.289.000 (dificult)
4 target- 41.789.000 (hard)

WHAT IS THE TOKEN (BLKO) UTILITY? 

That is the very interesting point. To Build BlackPoints.

WHAT IS A BLACKCPOINT?  (just an overview)

Blackpoint will be physical places, real places (a REAL-VERSE) where people live in harmony with the environment and leaving the minimum footprint. An ECO firendly place to live or stay that welcome to all BLK users to visit and explore. A Blackcpoint needs its own economy and this economy need to comunicate with the outside world. So, its necessary to could swap BLK and BLKO for LTC (liquidity with low fee) and with LTC access, have access to all liquidity that litecoin provides.
